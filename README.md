# Frontend Mentor - Interactive rating component solution

This is a solution to the [Interactive rating component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

## My process

It took me almost 12 hours to finish this project, I think it looks good but I don't have the exact measurements to build it, so it was based on my intuition, keep in mind that the proposed challenge only requires dimensions of 1440px for desktop and 375px for mobile devices, and I don't have the information to make it responsive. Surely there is much to improve, you can leave your suggestions. Thank you so much!
